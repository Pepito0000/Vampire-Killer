# Vampire killer - Project1
## Vampire Killer MSX2

"Vampire Killer" is a classic action-adventure platformer developed by [Konami](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami) for the MSX2 computer system in 1987. Set in a dark and foreboding Transylvanian castle, players control the vampire hunter Simon Belmont as he navigates treacherous corridors, battles hordes of monsters, and confronts iconic bosses. Armed with the legendary whip known as the Vampire Killer, players must explore the castle's interconnected rooms, solve puzzles, and uncover hidden secrets to ultimately vanquish the lord of darkness and save the land from eternal night.
