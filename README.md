# Vampire killer - Project1
## Vampire Killer MSX2

"Vampire Killer" is a classic action-adventure platformer developed by [Konami](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami) for the MSX2 computer system in 1987. Set in a dark and foreboding Transylvanian castle, players control the vampire hunter Simon Belmont as he navigates treacherous corridors, battles hordes of monsters, and confronts iconic bosses. Armed with the legendary whip known as the Vampire Killer, players must explore the castle's interconnected rooms, solve puzzles, and uncover hidden secrets to ultimately vanquish the lord of darkness and save the land from eternal night.

## Additional comments
I have tried to implement the losing condition in my game but encountered several unresolved bugs. Therefore, the current version does not include the losing condition. Similarly, I faced difficulties with the winning condition. Although I know how to implement it to display credits upon completing a level, the limitations of working alone and the reduced conditions of my project have hindered its full implementation.

My game currently operates only on one floor, as I haven't added stairs. At a certain level, a wall blocks the player's progress. Consequently, I decided to implement the winning condition when the player reaches the final accessible level on the first floor. In this last level, I successfully added a chest that, when hit, gives the player a blue ring. I also implemented a key to open the chest.

Unfortunately, there are many features I couldn't include due to similar issues, and they have been left out of the final game. Working alone on a project like this is challenging because many bugs are more easily resolved through collaboration. Often, one person can understand and solve a problem that the other cannot. In the end, I focused on completing the most important features, although some of them were still quite complicated for me to implement.
